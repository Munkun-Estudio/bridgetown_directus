- Automation now prompts for both Directus and Bridgetown collection names and sets up the initializer accordingly.
- Generated files are now flagged with `directus_generated: true` in front matter for safe cleanup.
- Only plugin-generated files (with this flag) are deleted during cleanup; user-authored files are preserved.
- Layouts for custom collections are now singular (e.g., `staff_member.erb`).
